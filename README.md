## PhD title: 
Using longitudinal administrative data to characterise mental health problems and substance misuse among women whose children enter care in England

## PhD brief summary:
Maternal mental health problems and substance misuse are key risk factors for child neglect or abuse and are common among children placed into state care in England. However, there is limited research characterising these maternal health needs, hindering the development of evidence-based policy for improved responses to maternal mental health and substance misuse in the context of child protection. Furthermore, large numbers of women have multiple children placed into care over their life course, with mental health problems and substance misuse a common and often contributing factor. This PhD research will address gaps in the evidence via four objectives. First, I will perform an ecological analysis to examine whether local prevalence of maternal mental health and substance misuse can help to explain the large variation in rates of entries into care across England. Second, I will evaluate a novel linkage between mental health service records and family court data on women with children subject to family court proceedings concerning placement into care (known as ‘care proceedings’). Third, using this linked data, I will describe type, timing, and severity of mental health problems and substance misuse among women involved in care proceedings, compared to other women accessing mental health services. Finally, I will identify population-level characteristics in the linked data that are predictive of women returning to the family court with further children. 

I will initially use unlinked national administrative health and children’s social care data sets before establishing and analysing the first linkage between family court data and electronic mental health records for women with children in care proceedings in England. The main PhD cohort will comprise all women (n = 3226) with children in care proceedings between 2007-2019 in Croydon, Lambeth, Lewisham, and Southwark local authorities, which are served by the South London and Maudsley NHS Mental Health Trust.
